LiveJam allows music aficianados to collab or jam out using virtual instruments.

The application allows “Jammers” to form or join dedicated rooms in which they can create tracks (and lifetime memories) with one another. LiveJam’s rooms currently allow for up to four Jammers to collab per session.

The app's use of direct peer-to-peer (serverless) communication, via WebRTC, allows users within 100 miles of one another to jam without lag, emulating the experience of using a real studio.
